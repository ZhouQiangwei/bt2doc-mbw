BatMeth2: DNA Methylation Data Analysis
=======================================

.. image:: media/BatMeth2-pipeline.jpg

BatMeth2 is an **easy-to-use, auto-run** package for DNA methylation analyses. 
In order to complete the DNA methylation data analysis more conveniently, 
we packaged all the functions to complete an easy-to-use, auto-run package for DNA methylation analysis. 
During the execution of BatMeth2 Tool, an html report is generated about statistics of the sample.

**Installation**

* Please download and install the tools (see :doc:`function/install`)

The functions you can use BatMeth2 to do:

* :doc:`function/Alignment`: Align bsseq data
* :doc:`function/Calmeth`: Calulate DNA methylation level (ML) across whole genome output mbw format.
* :doc:`function/bmtools`: tools for DNA methylation in mbw format, and prepare BigWIg file for browser.
* :doc:`function/DiffMeth`: Perform differential analyses with auto defined regions or predefined regions. 
* :doc:`function/PlotMeth`: Plot DNA ML profile, heatmap or boxplot across genes/TEs/etc.

While developing deepTools, we continuously strive to create software
that fulfills the following criteria:

-  **efficiently extract reads from BAM files** and perform various
   computations on them
-  **turn BAM files of aligned reads into bigWig files** using different
   normalization strategies
-  make use of **multiple processors** (speed!)
-  generation of **highly customizable images** (change colours, size,
   labels, file format, etc.)
-  enable **customized down-stream analyses**, meaning that every
   data set created can be stored by the user
-  **modular approach** - compatibility, flexibility, scalability (i.e.
   we can add more and more modules and make use of established methods)
